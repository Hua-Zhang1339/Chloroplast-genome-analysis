# ðŸŒ¾ Wheat Chloroplast Data Repository

This repository provides **sequencing data and complete genome resources** for wheat (*Triticum*) and its close relatives.
It is designed as an open-access reference for researchers working on wheat chloroplast genomics, evolution, and comparative studies.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

### 1. **Triticum Chloroplast Raw Data**

* Contains **raw sequencing data** of wheat chloroplasts.

### 2. **Chloroplast Genome**

* Contains **61 complete chloroplast genome assemblies** of wheat and its wild relatives.
* Each genome includes:

  * **FASTA sequence** (assembled chloroplast genome)
  * **Annotation files** (gene features, coding regions, tRNAs, rRNAs)
